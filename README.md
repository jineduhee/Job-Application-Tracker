# Job-Application-Tracker
A simple job application tracker that utilises python, html, api's, sound and etc.

NOTE: I've created this full-stack application that covers front-end and back-end, however, I am unable publish this full-stack version on GitHub Pages hence why I'll have the static implementation available on here alongside the full-stack implementation.
